I've been working in support field of an IT company for the last year, where I have to deal with coding from time to time. I enjoy discovering the principles of front-end development, it's interesting to know how I can influence the site's design and responsivness from the inside. I am enthusiastic, patient and determined, which I think would be extremely useful in further education.
